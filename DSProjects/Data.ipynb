    "# Bitcoin Historical Data Visualization and Analysis with Plotly and Dash\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This notebook aims to explore and visualize Bitcoin historical data to uncover trends and insights in Bitcoin's price movements and trading volume over time. We will use the Bitcoin data available from the [Kaggle Bitcoin Historical Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data) dataset, and leverage **Plotly** and **Dash** for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on File Size Rendering for Sharing\n",
    "Due to file size, this notebook may not render fully on some platforms (GITHUB *cough*). To view the graphs and interact with the data, please download and run it locally in Jupyter for full functionality with Dash and Plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Columns:\n",
    "- **Timestamp**: The time of the data point (Unix timestamp).\n",
    "- **Open**: Opening price of Bitcoin for the given time period.\n",
    "- **High**: The highest price of Bitcoin during the given time period.\n",
    "- **Low**: The lowest price of Bitcoin during the given time period.\n",
    "- **Close**: Closing price of Bitcoin for the given time period.\n",
    "- **Volume**: The trading volume of Bitcoin in the given time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals of the Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "   - **Load the dataset**: Import the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "   - **Handle missing values**: Identify and address any missing data points.\n",
    "   - **Timestamp conversion**: Convert the Unix timestamps into a human-readable datetime format for easier analysis.\n",
    "   - **Summary Statistics**: Calculate summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation for each numeric column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Interactive Visualization and Dashboard with Plotly & Dash**\n",
    "   - **Data Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of Bitcoin prices (Open, High, Low, Close) and Volume over years 2014-2018.\n",
    "   - **Candlestick Chart**: Display Bitcoin price movements (Open, High, Low, Close).\n",
    "   - **Dash App for Exploration**: Create an interactive dashboard with dropdowns, sliders, and filters.\n",
    "   - **Dynamic Updates**: Enable real-time interaction with visual components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Libraries\n",
    "We will be using the following libraries to read, clean, analyze, and visualize the data:\n",
    "- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations such as line charts, candlestick charts, and bar charts.\n",
    "- **Dash**: For building interactive dashboards that allow users to explore and interact with the data.\n",
    "- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we aim to:\n",
    "1. Gain a deeper understanding of Bitcoin's price movements over time.\n",
    "2. Identify periods of high volatility, bull markets, and bear markets.\n",
    "3. Build interactive visualizations that allow us to explore Bitcoin's historical data in a meaningful way.\n",
    "4. Create a user-friendly dashboard for users to interact with and analyze the data.\n",
    "5. Provide insights into the relationship between Bitcoin price and trading volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by loading the dataset, performing initial exploration, and setting up the interactive visuals with Plotly and Dash\n",
