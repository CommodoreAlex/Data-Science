## Key Projects

These projects showcase my focused work in data science, machine learning, and data visualization.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix Titles Dataset:**
- **Focus**: Data cleaning, trend analysis (genre, ratings, release year, certifications).
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy
- **Notebook**: [Netflix EDA Notebook](./netflix.ipynb)

**Expanding on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Bitcoin Historical Dataset:**
- **Focus**: Data cleaning, trend analysis of Bitcoin's price movements, volatility, and trading volume over time. This involves analyzing Bitcoin's opening, closing, high, and low prices, as well as the trading volume across different years (2014-2018), identifying patterns, and understanding market behavior.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Plotly, NumPy, Dash
- **Notebook**: [Bitcoin Data Visualization Notebook](./Data.ipynb)

## Supplementary Work

These are additional notebooks and resources focusing on foundational concepts or experimentation with tools.

**CRUD Operations with NumPy:**

- **Focus**: This notebook explores the basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using NumPy arrays, providing a foundation for data manipulation.
- **Tools**: Python, NumPy
- **Notebook**: [CRUD Operations with NumPy](./crud.ipynb)
