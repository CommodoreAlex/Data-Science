# Data Science Projects

This repository showcases my work as an **M.S. Computer Science (Data Science/AI) student**, with ongoing and future projects focused on key data science techniques. It highlights my commitment to learning and applying data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and other advanced methods to solve real-world problems.

### Expanding My Learning: AI Security & Red Teaming

Alongside my data science studies, I am actively pursuing the **AI Red Teamer Job Role Path** from **Hack The Box** and **Google** ([Course Link](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/ai-red-teamer)). This training builds expertise in **AI security, adversarial attacks, red teaming strategies, and model exploitation**, aligned with Google’s **Secure AI Framework (SAIF)**. By integrating **offensive security testing**, I aim to understand and mitigate vulnerabilities in AI-driven applications, complementing my broader AI and data science learning.
